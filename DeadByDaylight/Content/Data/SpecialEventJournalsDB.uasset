            Title: <b>1 - The Night</b>
            Subtitle: Oct. 19th
            Description: It is impossible to describe the horrifying scenes I have witnessed… death and misery, in every shape of terror, rule this place.<br><br>I can no longer recall how I have come to this place. All I remember is the opaque, milky fumes of opium in the murky den hazing a sweet, welcoming abyss.<br><br>I awoke to dreadful screams in this endless night, at the feet an old tree that leaked foul-smelling fluids. I know not how to reach those poor souls, nor do I want to. Keeping a record is all I can do to make sense of it.

            Title: <b>2 - Vigo</b>
            Subtitle: Oct. 20th
            Description: I discovered a hidden laboratory while running away from a monster. Its stocks are uncommonly plentiful. I observed shelves of alkaloids, crates of silver syringes, piles of protective clothes and a journal signed “Vigo.” Its pages are filled with notes on an ancient force that controls the nature of this place—that shapes it. I also noted a few drawings of the growing cankers I’ve seen on trees.

            Title: <b>3 - The Blight</b>
            Subtitle: Oct. 21st
            Description: I have been obsessively deciphering Vigo’s journal. His work is elegant but erratic, drawing obscure conclusions from disjointed fields.<br><br>Most entries mention a powerful force, The Entity, which undergoes a purge that occurs once a year. During this period, The Entity is infested with blight. According to Vigo, cankers bloom into “Pustulas,” a type of flower that spurts putrid nectar—the thick fluid I saw oozing from the trees. The last pages of the journal mention a serum distilled from the nectar, but the pages detailing its effects and preparation were torn out.

            Subtitle: Oct. 22nd
            Description: I’m hiding in a dense strip of forest. I’m desperate to erase the distressful images engraved in my mind. Last night, a disfigured man barged into the laboratory with a gruesome, mechanical mouth and shred the walls into splinters. I barely escaped with my life—and wounded my arm in the process.<br><br>I have no options left; these monsters find me no matter where I go. All I have is a journal filled with obscure promises of escape.<br><br>I will return to the laboratory.

            Subtitle: Oct. 23rd
            Description: I’m close to death, I can feel it.<br><br>When I returned to the laboratory, I started experimenting with the putrid nectar and distilled it into a foul serum. But I made a terrible mistake. I injected the serum into a dead rodent, whose pupils dilated, and its body shook. I tried to restrain it, but the creature bit into my arm, ripping my wound open.<br><br>I stopped the bleeding, but I fear the damage is done.

            Title: <b>6 - Experiment II</b>
            Subtitle: Oct. 24th
            Description: I awoke to a terrible cry booming from the cellar and a violent bout of nausea. Through the vile ordeal, I started to recollect what had happened.<br><br>Tainted with the foul serum, my wound had swollen with lymph, at which point my assailant returned. Most of our fight was a blur, but I can recall red tears trickling down his gruesome cheeks as I clawed at his face. And some moment later when I kicked him, sending him crashing into a brick wall. The power I felt then… there are no words for it. I now know that there is truth to Vigo’s methods.<br><br>Another cry. My assailant, now chained in the cellar, must be getting restless.<br><br>This is just the beginning.

            Description: I should have foreseen his escape, given the potent dosage I administered him, but I needed to see results.<br><br>Pustula flowers are now blooming on the path leading to the laboratory. According to Vigo’s journal, this rapid spread is a sign that the blight is at its peak.<br><br>Soon, there will be no more putrid nectar to extract.

            Description: I limited my rest to only a few minutes here and there--I cannot afford wasting time. Pustulas, once lush with nectar, were withering away at the roots of cankerous trees. I could only extract droplets from a few frail flowers.<br><br>I’m running out of time.
