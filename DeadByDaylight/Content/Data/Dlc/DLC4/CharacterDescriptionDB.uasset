She spent hours playing, streaming, competing to rise to the top. In the gaming world, she finally found respect. Nicknamed the “Shining Lion,” she was invited to join a prestigious e-sports team where she found a sanctuary free of the misconceptions and prejudice she had felt from her parents and the non-gaming world.<br><br>Feng Min pushed her limits to prove she was the best.

At night, she would stay up, tormented by the thought of disappointing her parents… and her fans. She spiraled out of control and fell into a pattern of self-destruction. She started wandering the streets and visiting bars, waking up in places she didn’t remember. One day she woke up somewhere completely different…

    BackStory: Showing exceptional aptitude in psychology, Herman was handpicked for special training in an advanced neuroscience program located in a secret black site facility in Illinois known as the Léry Memorial Institute, really a front for the CIA. This is where Herman met Dr. Otto Stamper where under his guidance, Herman began to use strange and ever increasingly vicious methods to extract information from prisoners sent to the institute, which was also a covert prison and re-education center for whoever was the USA’s current nemesis. His liberal use of violent electroshock therapy revealed dramatic results and several threats to national security were uncovered.<br><br>Over the years, Herman became known as The Doctor and no one ever questioned if he had even held a medical certificate or even what happened to the prisoners after they had given up their information. It was only after the Léry Memorial Institute went silent for a week that the true horror was finally discovered. The personnel, patients, and prisoners were all found dead with all types of head trauma. All personnel and prisoners' bodies were accounted for, including Dr. Otto Stamper, but no sign of Herman “The Doctor” Carter.<br>
