        Description: Awake Survivors hear <b>The Nightmare</b>'s Terror Radius and see him within 16 meters, intermittently see him from 16 to 32 meters, and cannot see him beyond that. <b>The Nightmare</b> passively puts Survivors to sleep and into the Dream World over a span of 60 seconds, and immediately puts them into the Dream World by hitting them with a <i>basic attack</i>.<br><br>In the Dream World, Survivors are afflicted with the <b>Oblivious</b> status effect and can be affected by <b>Dream Snares</b>. Survivors can wake up by failing Skill Checks, having an awake Survivor perform the <i>Wake Up action</i>, or using alarm clocks they find. Each successive <i>Wake Up action</i> takes twice as long. Alarm clocks provide Survivors with immunity to sleep for 30 seconds.<br><br><b>SPECIAL ABILITY: DREAM SNARE</b><br>Hold the <i>Power button</i> to place a <b>Dream Snare</b>. Survivors will be afflicted by the <b>Hindered</b> status effect during, and shortly after, touching a <b>Dream Snare</b>.<br><br>Some add-ons let <b>Dream Pallets</b> replace <b>Dream Snares</b>. Dream Pallets spawn at pallet locations in the Dream World. They are highlighted for <b>The Nightmare</b> and do not stun him.<br><br><b>DREAM TOKENS</b>:<br><b>The Nightmare</b> starts with 5 dream tokens to use for placing Dream Snares. When all tokens are spent, the oldest Dream Snare is destroyed as a new one is placed.<br><br><b>SPECIAL ABILITY: DREAM PROJECTION</b><br>Hold the <i>Active Ability button</i> to teleport to a generator in your view. For each Survivor in the Dream World, the cooldown is reduced by 15%.
