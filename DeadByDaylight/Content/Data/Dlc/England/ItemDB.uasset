        Description: Death won't accept him and thus he remains, a calamity, indisputable master of his victims' nightmares.<br><br><b>DREAM DEMON</b><br><b>The Nightmare</b> passively puts Survivors to sleep over 60 seconds, after which they enter the Dream World. Awake Survivors hear the terror radius and see <b>The Nightmare</b> from within 16 meters. <b>The Nightmare</b> appears intermittently to awake Survivors from 16 meters to 32 meters, and is invisible beyond that. Hitting an awake Survivor with a <i>basic attack</i> will put them into the Dream World.<br><br>Once in the Dream World, Survivors are afflicted with the <b>Oblivious</b> status effect and can be affected by <b>Dream Snares</b> or <b>Dream Pallets</b>. Survivors can wake up by failing skill checks, finding an awake Survivor to perform the <i>Wake Up action</i>, or by using the alarm clocks within the environment. Each successive <i>Wake Up action</i> takes twice as long to perform. Using an alarm clock will give Survivors a period of 30 seconds before they start falling asleep again.<br><br><b>SPECIAL ABILITY: DREAM SNARE</b><br>Hold the <i>Power button</i> to place a <b>Dream Snare</b> on the ground directly in front of The Nightmare. Survivors that touch a <b>Dream Snare</b> will be afflicted by the <b>Hindered</b> status effect, slowing them while they remain in the trap and for a short duration after.<br><br><b>SPECIAL ABILITY: DREAM PROJECTION</b><br>Hold the <i>Active Ability button</i> to perform a <b>Dream Projection</b> and teleport to a generator in your view. For each Survivor in the Dream World, the cooldown of <b>Dream Projection</b> is reduced by 15%.
