    DisplayName: William "Bill" Overbeck
    BackStory: It took two tours in Vietnam, a handful of medals, a knee full of shrapnel, and an honorable discharge to get William "Bill" Overbeck to stop fighting and try to live a peaceful life. He hated it. <br><br>After decades spent drifting aimlessly through dead end jobs, Bill went in for a routine surgery and woke up to find the world he knew was gone. A plague was turning normal people into mindless killing machines. Naturally, the first thing he did was fight his way home and put on his uniform. Making his way through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests, he found other Survivors, and together they fled from the infected hordes. <br><br>In the end, Bill sacrificed himself to ensure their safety. His body was never found. Bill was left for dead. No one knows that he still has the only thing he ever wanted: an enemy to fight.
    Biography: An old soldier, accustomed to dealing with critical situations.<BR><BR>His personal perks, <B>Left Behind</B>, <B>Borrowed Time</B> and <B>Unbreakable</B>, make him more powerful in dire moments.
