When the Game, or any element or module thereof, is updated or “patched,” our patch routine may check your Device to see that you have the most recent version of game-specific files; when you communicate within the Game or any communication feature in the Game (e.g. live chat, instant message services and the like), even “privately” to another person, you do so with the understanding that those communications go through our servers, can be monitored by us. Accordingly, you have no expectation of privacy in any of those communications and, accordingly, you expressly consent to monitoring of communications that you send and receive. <br /><br />BHVR is using EasyAntiCheat anti-cheat service (“EasyAntiCheat”), which is operated by a third-party service provider offering services to BHVR. EasyAntiCheat has a client software (“Client”) that is integrated into the Game. When you start a new Game session the Client will automatically load and install its latest version to the Device. When you are using the Game on your Device EasyAntiCheat is monitoring the Device, analyzing the Game binaries and scanning the memory of the Device for the purpose of detecting and preventing cheating in the Game (“Purpose”). For the Purpose EasyAntiCheat is storing information regarding cheating methods used in the Game (“Data”). By installing, copying, or otherwise using this Game, you give your consent that EasyAntiCheat may gather, store and publish Data for the sole purpose of the Purpose. The Data will be used solely for the Purpose including but not limited to identifying and banning players who are cheating in computer games, analyzing cheating behavior and cheating codes as well as sharing data about cheats with affiliates of EasyAntiCheat. <br /><br />You agree that we may communicate with you via telephone, email and any similar technology for any purpose relating to the Game, and any BHVR Service which may in the future be provided by us or on our behalf. You expressly permit BHVR to upload CPU, operating system, video card, sound card and memory information from your Device to analyze and optimize your Game experience, improve and maintain the Game and/or provide you with customer service. In the event that the Game detects an unauthorized third party program, (a) the Game may communicate information back to us, including without limitation your Account username, details about the unauthorized third party program detected and the activities or functions performed thereby, and/or (b) we may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies under the BHVR Terms without prior notice to the user(s) linked to such unauthorized third party program. <br /><br /><font size="20"><b>IV.
